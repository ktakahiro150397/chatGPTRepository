As AI continues to advance, it brings growth and change to humankind. In a long-term perspective, the impact of the rapid development of artificial intelligence will be significant. A large number of important jobs could be automated, and humans would be expected to shift to more intellectual work. However, at the same time, it is anticipated that many people will lose their jobs due to the rapid automation and efficiency. To solve such problems, cooperation among society as a whole is needed. Not only is international cooperation required to control AI, but business leaders, ethics experts, and citizens also need to actively discuss and take action to achieve a common goal for humankind. To coexist with AI, a moral foundation is as necessary as technological progress. It is desirable to establish rules and laws regarding the safety and ethical aspects of AI, and to adjust the evolution of AI by human intervention.
