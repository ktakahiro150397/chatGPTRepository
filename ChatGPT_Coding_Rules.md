# ChatGPT Coding Rules

- When presenting shell scripts, programming languages, git commands, etc., always follow the rules below.
- At the beginning of the script, write the name of the file. Do not include any comments to avoid confusion with other commands.
- At the end of the script, add //file end without including any comments.
- At the beginning of a git command, always add //git start.
- At the end of a git command, always add //git end.
- Do not include // in the command.
- Variables, commands, etc. used in each script must be written inside the script.
- If the comment would be used commonly, it should be placed directly in the script or command as much as possible.
